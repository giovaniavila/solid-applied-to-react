# SOLID Applied to Frontend

## Overview

"SOLID Applied to Frontend" is a project that explores the application of the SOLID principles in frontend development. The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that help developers create maintainable, scalable, and robust software. This project demonstrates how these principles can be applied effectively in the context of modern frontend frameworks like React.

## SOLID Principles

The SOLID acronym stands for:

1. **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. **O** - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
3. **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each principle is implemented in various components of the project, showcasing best practices and design patterns that lead to cleaner and more manageable code.

## Features

- Demonstrates the application of each SOLID principle in frontend development.
- Interactive examples and code snippets for better understanding.
- User-friendly interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
